Yet another "Hello World" repository

**I just drank yet another large matcha late. My hands are shaking. It could be from the caffene, or it could be how I've been sleeping in 12 hour chunks every day and a half and eating large quantities of food, but with 20 hour gaps in between dinner and breakfast. This rotating cycle feels natural to me, but my body probably doesn't like it very much. 
    
    Being human is annoying. You have to eat and drink ALL THE TIME or else you get weak or dizzy. Which is stupid. You can survive for up to *SIXTY* days without food, so why is 24 hours so dibilitating? And why do we dehydrate so fast. How have we, as a species, survived this long? I swear to god. Is it just that I've grown up in an environment with ample food so my body is maladjusted to survival, or is this really how we are made? Sheez. I just need some sort of IV nutrition pack, sort of like one of those automatic insulin pumps, that can provide calories and protein so my muscles don't eat themselves (what few I have *note: get more muscles*) and some sort of water drip that can take moisture out of the atmosphere and filter it.

*note: this already exists, find name of that israeli created device that works on solar panels and adapt to personal, purse size use.*

Imagine, a world where everyone has two, phone sized devices that provide food and water out of almost nothing. Voila, end of human hunger and water issues. Minimal power use and all that's required is a small input of glucose protein nutrient gel. In third world countries it will be a sign of poverty but will save millions of malnourished children. In the Americas, it will become a sign of wealth; some crazy new diet fad to get the ideal body. Like pizza. The peasents started to eat it and the rich were all "what if we rebrand this cheap peasent food and make it a cullinary icon of our nation?" 

So yes, if I had one iota of focus/ a much longer lifespan so I wouldn't blink twice at wasting 10 years of my life on startups, I would revolutionize the world with this. Maybe.

Man. All I really want is to not have to walk to the Marketplace every goddamn day in the 10 min gap between my classes. 

Oh. And I learned you can edit a branch that is not the Master branch and save changes. Whaddya know.
